dist: bionic
script:
# ubuntu-bionic specific steps: the standard gcc/g++ packages do not
# support c++17, so a higher-versioned compiler needs to be installed.
#
# note: this won't be necessary on later versions of Ubuntu, or other
# Linux distros, which is why the compiler version isn't baked into
# the scripts (e.g. these steps are unnecessary in Debian Buster)
- sudo apt-get install gcc-8 g++-8
